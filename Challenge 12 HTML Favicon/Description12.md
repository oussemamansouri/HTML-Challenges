# Challenge 12: HTML Favicon

In this challenge, you will learn how to add a favicon to your HTML pages. A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab. It helps users quickly identify your website among many open tabs.

## Task: Adding a Favicon

To add a favicon to your website, follow these steps:

1. **Choose a Favicon Image:**
   - You can use any image as a favicon. The image should be simple with high contrast due to its small size.
   - You can create a favicon using online tools like [favicon.cc](https://www.favicon.cc).

2. **Save Your Favicon:**
   - Save your favicon image as "favicon.ico".
   - Place this file in the root directory of your webserver. Alternatively, you can create a folder named "images" in the root directory and save the favicon image there.

3. **Link the Favicon in HTML:**
   - Add a `<link>` element to your HTML file to reference the favicon image. This `<link>` element should be placed within the `<head>` section of your HTML document, immediately after the `<title>` element.

## Requirements:

- Use a favicon image file named "favicon.ico".
- Add the appropriate `<link>` element to your HTML document to reference the favicon.

## Tips:

- The favicon image should be a square image (e.g., 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels).
- Ensure the image is clear and recognizable, even at small sizes.

## Example:

The favicon will be displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab.

By completing this challenge, you will enhance your website's branding and usability by ensuring your site is easily recognizable in browser tabs.
