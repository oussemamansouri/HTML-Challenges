# Challenge 14: HTML Form Elements 

## Objective

In this challenge, you will create a form using a variety of HTML form elements including input fields, labels, select dropdowns, text areas, buttons, fieldsets, and datalists. You will also group related fields using the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements to make the form more organized and user-friendly.

## Requirements

1. **Input Fields:**
   - Create an input field for the userâ€™s name. Use the `<label>` element to associate the label "Name" with the input field. 
   - Add another input field for email with an associated label "Email."

2. **Select Dropdown:**
   - Add a `<select>` dropdown that allows the user to choose their country of residence. Provide at least 4 options (e.g., USA, Canada, UK, France).

3. **Text Area:**
   - Add a `<textarea>` element for additional comments. Use the `rows` and `cols` attributes to specify its size.

4. **Radio Buttons and Checkboxes:**
   - Include a group of radio buttons for the user to select their gender (Male, Female, Other). Use the `<label>` element to make the radio buttons accessible.
   - Include checkboxes for selecting interests (e.g., Coding, Sports, Reading).

5. **Fieldset and Legend:**
   - Use the `<fieldset>` element to group the personal information fields (Name, Email, and Gender). Add a `<legend>` element to label this group as "Personal Information."

6. **Datalist:**
   - Add a datalist for selecting a preferred programming language. Use the `<input>` element with the `list` attribute, and provide several options inside the `<datalist>` element (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C++).

7. **Submit Button:**
   - Add a submit button at the end of the form using the `<button>` element. Make sure it has the text "Submit Form."

## Bonus Requirements

1. Use the `<output>` element to display a result (e.g., "Thank you for submitting your form!") after the form is submitted.
2. Make sure that the form is visually appealing by adding appropriate spacing between the form elements.

## Instructions

1. Create an HTML file (`solution.html`) containing all the form elements described above.
2. Use appropriate form attributes (like `name`, `id`, `placeholder`, and `required`) to enhance the user experience.
3. Ensure the form is functional and logically organized.
4. Test the form in a browser to ensure it meets the requirements.

## Example Output

When completed, your form should allow users to fill in their name, email, select their gender, choose their country, list their interests, and submit the form. The form should be visually organized and easy to interact with.

Happy coding!
