# Challenge 16: HTML Iframes

## Objective

In this challenge, you will create a web page that embeds another webpage using the HTML `<iframe>` element. You will learn how to control the size, border, and how to target the iframe for a link.

## Requirements

1. **Basic Iframe:**
   - Create an iframe that displays a specified webpage.
   - The `src` attribute should point to a valid webpage URL.
   - Add a `title` attribute to describe the iframe content for accessibility.

2. **Set Height and Width:**
   - Set the iframe's height to 400px and width to 600px using the `height` and `width` attributes.

3. **Remove Border:**
   - Remove the iframe border using the CSS `border: none;` style.

4. **Target Iframe with a Link:**
   - Create a hyperlink that loads another webpage into the iframe when clicked. Use the `target` attribute of the link to refer to the `name` attribute of the iframe.

## Instructions

1. Create an HTML file (`solution.html`) that contains an iframe and follows the specifications mentioned above.
2. The iframe should load an external website or another HTML file, and the link should target this iframe.
3. Use the height, width, and CSS properties to control the appearance of the iframe.
4. Test the page to ensure the link loads content into the iframe correctly.

## Example Output

The webpage should display an iframe that shows the embedded content, with no borders. When clicking on the link, a new webpage should load inside the iframe.

Good luck and happy coding!
