# Challenge 13: HTML Form Attributes

In this challenge, you will learn how to use various attributes in an HTML `<form>` element. Forms are essential for collecting user input, and understanding form attributes is key to making them functional and user-friendly.

## Task 1: The Action Attribute

The `action` attribute defines where the form data should be sent when submitted.

### Requirements:
- Create a form with the `action` attribute set to "submit_form.php".
- Add a text input field and a submit button.
- When the form is submitted, the data should be sent to "submit_form.php".

## Task 2: The Target Attribute

The `target` attribute specifies where to display the response after submitting the form.

### Requirements:
- Add the `target` attribute to the form.
- Use the value `_blank` so the form response opens in a new tab.
- Add a text input and a submit button to this form.

## Task 3: The Method Attribute

The `method` attribute specifies how to send the form data to the server.

### Requirements:
- Create a form with the `method` attribute set to `post`.
- Add a password input field and a submit button.
- When the form is submitted, the data should be sent using HTTP POST.

## Task 4: The Autocomplete Attribute

The `autocomplete` attribute controls whether a form allows browsers to automatically fill in previously entered information.

### Requirements:
- Create a form with the `autocomplete` attribute set to `on`.
- Add fields for username and email, along with a submit button.
- The form should allow autocomplete.

## Task 5: The Novalidate Attribute

The `novalidate` attribute specifies that form data should not be validated upon submission.

### Requirements:
- Create a form with the `novalidate` attribute.
- Add an email input field with the `required` attribute.
- Add a submit button that bypasses validation when the form is submitted.

### Summary

You will explore the following form attributes:
- `action`: Defines the form's submission URL.
- `target`: Determines where to display the response after submission.
- `method`: Specifies the HTTP method to use when submitting the form data.
- `autocomplete`: Controls autocomplete behavior in the browser.
- `novalidate`: Disables form validation during submission.
