# Challenge 04: HTML Comments

In this challenge, you will learn how to use HTML comments. Comments are useful for adding explanations, notes, or hiding parts of your code without displaying them in the browser.

### Instructions:
1. Add comments to your HTML file to document different sections of the code.
2. Use comments to temporarily hide some HTML content.
3. Try using inline comments within a paragraph.
4. Remember, comments are not visible in the browser but can be very helpful for developers reviewing the code.

### Example:
- Add a comment before a paragraph to explain its purpose.
- Hide a section of HTML code, like an image or a line of text.
- Use inline comments to hide part of the content inside a paragraph.

By the end of this challenge, you will have a well-documented HTML file using comments effectively.
