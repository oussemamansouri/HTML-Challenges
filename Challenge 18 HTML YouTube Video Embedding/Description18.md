# Challenge 18: HTML YouTube Video Embedding 

## Objective

In this challenge, you will embed a YouTube video into your web page using an `<iframe>` element. You will learn how to customize the YouTube video player by modifying various attributes like autoplay, mute, loop, and controls.

## Requirements

1. **Embed a YouTube Video:**
   - Use the `<iframe>` tag to embed a YouTube video into your webpage.
   - Choose any YouTube video of your preference and embed it using the video ID.

2. **Autoplay and Mute:**
   - Set the video to autoplay when the page loads but keep it muted to avoid disturbing visitors.
   
3. **Loop the Video:**
   - Set the video to loop infinitely so that it keeps playing repeatedly.

4. **Hide Controls:**
   - Hide the video controls (play, pause, volume) to create a cleaner, minimalistic look.

5. **Set Custom Dimensions:**
   - Set the width and height of the video player to 560x315 pixels.

## Instructions

1. Create an HTML file (`solution.html`) and embed a YouTube video using an `<iframe>`.
2. Add autoplay, mute, loop, and controls parameters to the video URL to meet the requirements.
3. Set the player size to 560x315 pixels using the `width` and `height` attributes.
4. Choose any video of your preference from YouTube and use its video ID to embed it.

## Example Output

The webpage should display a YouTube video that autoplays on load (muted), loops forever, and does not display player controls. The video size should be 560x315 pixels.
