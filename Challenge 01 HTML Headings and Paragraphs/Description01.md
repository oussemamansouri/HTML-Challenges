# Challenge 01: HTML Headings and Paragraphs

In this challenge, you will practice using HTML headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) and paragraphs (`<p>`). Headings help organize content on a webpage, while paragraphs allow you to add blocks of text.

## Instructions:
1. Create a webpage that uses all six levels of HTML headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).
2. Add at least two paragraphs explaining the purpose of HTML headings and how they are used.
3. Include a horizontal rule (`<hr>`) to visually separate different sections.
4. Use line breaks (`<br>`) inside a paragraph to create new lines without starting a new paragraph.

## Example:
The webpage should look something like this:
- A main heading introducing the page.
- Subheadings explaining different aspects of HTML headings.
- A few paragraphs with text content.
