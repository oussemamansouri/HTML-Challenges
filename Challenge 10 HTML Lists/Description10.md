# Challenge 10: HTML Lists

In this challenge, you'll explore three different types of lists in HTML: unordered lists, ordered lists, and description lists. Lists are a fundamental tool for organizing content on a webpage, allowing related items to be grouped together in a clear and structured way.

## Task 1: Unordered List

An unordered list (`<ul>`) is used to display a list of items where the order of the items doesn't matter. Each item within the unordered list is wrapped in a `<li>` tag. The default style is to display the list items with bullet points (small black circles).

### Requirements:
- Create an unordered list with at least three items.

## Task 2: Ordered List

An ordered list (`<ol>`) is used when the order of the list items is significant, such as a set of steps in a process or a ranked list. Each item within the ordered list is also wrapped in a `<li>` tag, and by default, the list items are numbered sequentially.

### Requirements:
- Create an ordered list with at least three items.
- Optionally, use the `start` attribute to make the list begin at a specific number rather than the default of 1.

## Task 3: Description List

A description list (`<dl>`) is used to display a list of terms and their corresponding descriptions. Unlike ordered and unordered lists, a description list pairs terms with descriptions, making it useful for glossaries, definitions, or lists of items with more detailed explanations.

### Requirements:
- Create a description list containing at least two terms with corresponding descriptions.
- Each term should be enclosed in the `<dt>` tag, and each description should be enclosed in the `<dd>` tag.

## Task 4: Nested Lists

HTML allows lists to be nested, meaning you can place one list inside another to create sub-items. This is useful for creating hierarchical structures, such as a main list item with several sub-items underneath it.

### Requirements:
- Create a nested list where one or more list items in an unordered list contain another unordered or ordered list inside.

## Task Summary:

- Create an unordered list.
- Create an ordered list and optionally customize the start number.
- Create a description list with terms and descriptions.
- Implement nested lists to show a hierarchy of items.

Upon completing this challenge, you will have a solid understanding of how to use HTML lists to organize and present content effectively.
