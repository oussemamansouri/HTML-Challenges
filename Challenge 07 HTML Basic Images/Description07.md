# HTML Challenge: Images

## Objective
Create a webpage that displays an image using the `<img>` tag. This will include:
1. An image with a valid `src` attribute pointing to an image file.
2. An alternate text (`alt` attribute) for the image to describe it.
3. Set the width and height of the image using both the `style` attribute and the `width`/`height` attributes.

## Requirements
- Use the `<img>` tag to display an image.
- Make sure the image has both the `src` and `alt` attributes.
- Set the size of the image using the `style` attribute.
- Additionally, set the size of another image using the `width` and `height` attributes.

## Bonus
- Display a second image and intentionally break the `src` attribute to show the alt text and the broken image icon.
