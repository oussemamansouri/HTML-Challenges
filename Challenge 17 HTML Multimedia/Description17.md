# HTML Multimedia Challenge

## Objective

In this challenge, you will create a web page that includes both audio and video elements using HTML. You will learn how to embed multimedia content like music and videos into your webpage using different supported formats.

## Requirements

1. **Embed Video:**
   - Embed a video in the HTML page using the `<video>` element.
   - The video should be in `MP4` format, which is supported by all browsers.
   - Add controls to the video player (play, pause, volume).

2. **Embed Audio:**
   - Embed an audio file using the `<audio>` element.
   - The audio should be in `MP3` format.
   - Add controls to the audio player (play, pause, volume).

3. **Provide Alternative Formats:**
   - For both video and audio, provide alternative formats (like Ogg) in case the user's browser does not support MP4 or MP3.

4. **Description:**
   - Add a description above the video and audio, explaining what each multimedia element represents.

5. **Multimedia Summary:**
   - Add a summary section at the bottom of the page explaining what multimedia formats are supported by modern browsers.

## Instructions

1. Create an HTML file (`solution.html`) that includes both audio and video elements with the specifications mentioned above.
2. Make sure to use the `controls` attribute so that users can interact with the multimedia.
3. Provide at least two formats for both video and audio to ensure browser compatibility.
4. Include a brief summary explaining the common multimedia formats supported by HTML5.

## Example Output

The webpage should display a video player and an audio player with full controls. The description should help users understand the content, and the summary should explain the supported multimedia formats.

Good luck and enjoy working with multimedia!
