# Challenge 08: HTML Image Maps

## Objective
Create an interactive image using an image map with clickable areas. The goal is to define areas on an image that perform different actions when clicked.

## Requirements
- Use the `<map>` element to create an image map.
- Use the `<area>` elements to define clickable areas with different shapes (rectangle, circle, or polygon).
- Each clickable area should have a unique action associated with it, such as linking to different pages.

## Example Scenario
You will create an image map for a house layout. The clickable areas will allow the user to navigate to pages for the different rooms: kitchen, living room, and garden.

This example is adapted from the image map tutorial found at [W3Schools HTML Image Maps](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_imagemap.asp).

## Bonus
- Use the `poly` shape to create a more complex clickable area, such as for the garden.
